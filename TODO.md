You were trying to fix the math behind the populationPerCoordinate thing.

# Issues I've Noticed

- There shouldn't be a random bool to decide if it should infect. It should pretty much always be infecting.

- There should be multiple intervals for each continent. Once a continent is infected, it should have it's own interval.

- The math on how a new dot should appear seems to be off.

- Something stops happening after day 11.
