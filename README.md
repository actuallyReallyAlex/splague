## üßê About <a name="about"></a>

Splague is a plague simulator, adventure quest, and open-source project all rolled into one. It will be available as a web-based game for the browser, an Electron application, and a React-Native application for phones. Your game will be saved to a database, allowing for synchronization between all platforms of the application.

The game is currently being developed, and is expected to be released in the Fall of 2019.

Splague is open-source! Feel free to go to Splague's GitHub repository and create a pull request or issue with what you would like added.
